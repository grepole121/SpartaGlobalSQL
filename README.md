# SpartaGlobalSQL

During the 2nd week at Sparta Global we had an SQL Project.  

We went through:  
- Normalisation (1NF, 2NF, 3NF)  
- One to one, one to many, many to many databases  
- Data manipulation language (DML)  
- Data definition language (DDL)  
- Data control language (DCL)  
- Transaction control language (TCL)  
- Datatypes (VARCHAR, CHAR, INT, DATA, DECIMAL, BINARY, etc.)  
- NULL  
- LIKE ('%', '\_', charlists)  
- Functions  
- JOINs  
- SQL processing sequence  

We used this knowledge to develop this project
